        "correctAnswer": "D",
        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "This is a classic 'Prescribing Pattern Indicator.' Monitoring the frequency of injections helps assess clinical decision-making, as overuse can be costly, increase the risk of infection, and may not be necessary. It is a direct measure of how drugs are being prescribed.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "A drug's country of origin does not determine if its use is rational.",
                "B": "This is an outcome indicator related to patient safety (pharmacovigilance), not a direct measure of the prescribing pattern itself.",
                "C": "Hospitals do not have budgets for advertising drugs to consumers.",
                "E": "The ratio of staff is a structural indicator of hospital resources, not a measure of prescribing behavior."

        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "This choice perfectly encapsulates the global definition of Rational Drug Use (RDU). The project's goal is to ensure that patients receive medicine appropriate for their clinical needs, in the correct dose, for an adequate duration, and at the lowest possible cost to them and the community, all guided by scientific evidence.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "The goal is to reduce irrational drug use, not to stop the use of necessary medications.",

                "C": "The project aims for rational access to all necessary medicines, not to create barriers to essential treatments.",

            "correct": "A primary indicator for the success of the RDU project is the reduction of antibiotic prescriptions for conditions that are often viral, such as upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) and acute diarrhea. This measure directly addresses the critical national goal of combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR).",

            "correct": "The national RDU policy is driven at the highest level by the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH), which sets the overarching strategy. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the key operational agency within the MOPH responsible for drug regulation and implementation. Together, they form the primary authority for guiding and overseeing the project.",

            "correct": "Community health volunteers (known in Thai as Or Sor Mor) are a cornerstone of Thailand's primary healthcare system.
