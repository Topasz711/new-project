    "question": "A 54-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a 2-day history of a swollen, erythematous, and exquisitely tender right knee. He reports high-grade fever and is unable to flex the joint or bear weight. Based on the most likely diagnosis, which of the following is NOT a typical radiographic finding?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Rapid, uniform joint space narrowing",
      "B": "Deep soft tissue swelling obliterating fat planes",
      "C": "Marginal and central osseous erosions",
      "D": "Periarticular osteopenia",
      "E": "Subchondral sclerosis and osteophytes"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "E",
    "reasoning": {
      "correct": "The clinical presentation (fever, acute onset, red/hot joint) is classic for Septic Arthritis. Subchondral sclerosis (whitening of bone) and osteophytes (bone spurs) are hallmarks of Osteoarthritis (OA), which is a chronic, degenerative process involving 'wear and repair.' These findings take years to develop and are not seen in acute infection.",
      "incorrect": {
        "A": "In septic arthritis, proteolytic enzymes from bacteria and leukocytes rapidly destroy cartilage, leading to uniform joint space narrowing within days.",
        "B": "Significant inflammation causes soft tissue swelling, which blurs or obliterates the normal lucent fat planes on X-ray.",
        "C": "As the infection progresses, the inflammatory pannus destroys the bone, causing erosions at the margins and centrally.",
        "D": "Hyperemia (increased blood flow) due to acute inflammation causes rapid bone resorption, appearing as periarticular osteopenia (washed-out bone density)."

    "question": "A 22-year-old football player sustains a direct high-velocity blow to the mid-tibia during a match. He experiences immediate severe pain and is unable to ambulate. Standard radiographs are obtained to evaluate the injury. Which of the following pathological features is NOT directly visible on plain film radiography?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Displacement or angulation of bone fragments",
      "B": "Radiolucent lines traversing the bone shaft",
      "C": "Bone marrow edema",
      "D": "Disruption of the cortical bone continuity",
      "E": "Distortion of the trabecular bone pattern"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "reasoning": {
      "correct": "Bone marrow edema refers to fluid/inflammation within the trabecular marrow space. While this significantly alters signal intensity on MRI (bright on T2/STIR sequences), it does not alter the radiographic density enough to be visible on a standard X-ray (plain film).",
      "incorrect": {
        "A": "Gross deformity, such as displacement or angulation, is clearly visible as a misalignment of the bone structures.",
        "B": "The fracture gap usually contains blood or soft tissue, which is less dense than bone, appearing as a dark (radiolucent) line.",
        "D": "The break in the hard outer shell of the bone (cortical disruption) is the primary sign looked for in fractures.",
        "E": "The internal spongey bone architecture (trabecular pattern) appears interrupted or distorted at the fracture site."

      "correct": "The Anterior Superior Iliac Spine (ASIS) is the prominent bony projection at the anterior end of the iliac crest. It is a key landmark visible on AP pelvic films.",
      "incorrect": {
        "A": "The Anterior Inferior Iliac Spine is located inferior to the ASIS (just above the acetabulum).",
        "C": "The Posterior Superior Iliac Spine is located on the back of the pelvis and is usually superimposed on the sacrum/ilium in an AP view, not at the lateral/anterior edge.",
        "D": "The Posterior Inferior Iliac Spine is also posterior and lower.",

      "correct": "The arrow points to the posterior bony prominence of the Atlas (C1). While anatomically termed the 'Posterior Tubercle' (since C1 lacks a true spinous process), in the context of multiple-choice options for identifying the posterior structure of C1 vs C2, this choice represents the posterior arch structure of C1.",
      "incorrect": {
        "A": "Transverse processes project laterally. On a lateral film, they are superimposed over the vertebral bodies/facets and are not the distinct posterior projections.",
        "B": "Transverse processes project laterally. On a lateral film, they are superimposed over the vertebral bodies/facets and are not the distinct posterior projections.",
        "D": "The spinous process of C2 (Axis) is very large, prominent, and located inferior to the C1 arch. It is often the first palpable spinous process.",

      "correct": "The projection is the Transcapular view (or Scapular Y-view), used to assess dislocations. The 'Y' shape is formed by the scapular body (bottom), Coracoid (anterior branch), and Acromion (posterior/superior branch). The arrow points to the Acromion at the top/back of the Y.",
      "incorrect": {
        "A": "While it is a 'lateral' view of the scapula, the specific technical name is Transcapular or Y-view. Furthermore, the Coronoid process is in the elbow (ulna), not the shoulder (the shoulder has a Coracoid process).",
        "B": "While it is a 'lateral' view of the scapula, the specific technical name is Transcapular or Y-view.",
        "C": "The Coracoid process forms the anterior branch of the Y, not the superior/posterior one.",

      "correct": "The classic radiographic triad for chronic Gout includes 'punched-out' erosions (often away from the joint surface), sclerotic borders (indicating a slow, non-aggressive process), and 'overhanging edges' (Martel's sign). Soft tissue masses representing tophi are also common.",
      "incorrect": {
        "A": "Rheumatoid arthritis typically presents with osteopenia (bone loss) and erosions without sclerotic borders.",
        "B": "Osteoarthritis is characterized by sclerosis (whitening) and osteophytes (spurs), but not the deep punched-out erosions seen in gout.",
        "D": "CPPD is defined by chondrocalcinosis (calcification of cartilage), which looks like white lines inside the joint space.",

      "correct": "This is the classic description of Osteoarthritis (OA).
