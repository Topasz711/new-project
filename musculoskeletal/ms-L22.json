    "question": "A 45-year-old male presents with chronic hip pain. Radiographs reveal a 'crescent sign' (semilunar line) in the subchondral bone of the femoral head, indicating subchondral collapse. Which of the following is the most likely risk factor associated with this patient's condition?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Vitamin D Deficiency",
      "B": "Chronic Alcohol Use",
      "C": "Bisphosphonate Therapy",
      "D": "Hyperuricemia",
      "E": "Staphylococcus aureus infection"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "reasoning": {
      "correct": "The clinical presentation describes Avascular Necrosis (Osteonecrosis) of the femoral head. The 'crescent sign' is a pathognomonic radiological finding indicating a subchondral fracture due to bone death. Chronic alcohol use and long-term corticosteroid therapy are the two most common non-traumatic causes of AVN. Alcohol causes adipogenesis in the marrow, increasing intraosseous pressure and reducing blood flow.",
      "incorrect": {
        "A": "Vitamin D deficiency leads to Osteomalacia (in adults) or Rickets (in children), characterized by poorly mineralized bone (soft bones), not ischemic necrosis.",
        "C": "Bisphosphonate therapy is associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), but it is generally used to treat osteoporosis and is not a primary cause of femoral head AVN.",
        "D": "Hyperuricemia causes Gout. While gout affects joints, it causes erosive arthritis and tophi, not the specific subchondral ischemic collapse seen in AVN.",
        "E": "Staphylococcus aureus infection causes Osteomyelitis (pyogenic infection). This would present with fever, systemic signs, and bone destruction/pus, rather than a clean subchondral fracture line (crescent sign)."

    "question": "A 22-year-old male complains of dull, aching pain in his spine that worsens at night. He reports that the pain is NOT relieved by aspirin or NSAIDs. Imaging reveals a 3.5 cm radiolucent nidus with surrounding sclerosis. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Ewing Sarcoma",
      "B": "Osteoid Osteoma",
      "C": "Osteosarcoma",
      "D": "Osteoblastoma",
      "E": "Osteochondroma"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "reasoning": {
      "correct": "Osteoblastoma is histologically similar to Osteoid Osteoma (both form osteoid). However, Osteoblastoma is distinguished by being larger (>2 cm)—here it is 3.5 cm—and usually involves the spine. Crucially, the pain is NOT relieved by aspirin, differentiating it from Osteoid Osteoma.",
      "incorrect": {
        "A": "Ewing Sarcoma is a malignant tumor typically found in the diaphysis of long bones with an 'onion-skin' periosteal reaction, not a sclerotic nidus in the spine.",
        "B": "Osteoid Osteoma is typically smaller (<2 cm) and presents with night pain that is dramatically relieved by aspirin (due to prostaglandin inhibition).",
        "C": "Osteosarcoma is a high-grade malignancy with a 'sunburst' appearance, typically in the metaphysis of long bones (around the knee), not a well-defined nidus.",
        "E": "Osteochondroma is a bony projection with a cartilage cap (exostosis), growing away from the joint, not a nidus within the bone."

  {
    "question": "A 12-year-old boy presents with a painful mass in the femoral diaphysis. Radiographs show a lytic lesion with a multi-layered 'onion-skin' periosteal reaction. Cytogenetic analysis would most likely reveal which chromosomal translocation?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "t(11;22)",
      "B": "t(12;16)",
      "C": "t(9;22)",
      "D": "t(2;13)",
      "E": "t(X;18)"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "reasoning": {
      "correct": "The case describes Ewing Sarcoma (child, diaphysis, onion-skin appearance). The hallmark genetic driver is the fusion of the EWS gene on chromosome 22 with the FLI1 gene on chromosome 11, creating the t(11;22) translocation.",
      "incorrect": {
        "B": "t(12;16) is characteristic of Myxoid Liposarcoma (FUS-DDIT3 fusion).",
        "C": "t(9;22) is the Philadelphia chromosome found in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML).",
        "D": "t(2;13) is characteristic of Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma (PAX3-FOXO1 fusion).",

      "C": "Ewing Sarcoma",
      "D": "Multiple Myeloma",
      "E": "Osteosarcoma"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "reasoning": {
      "correct": "Chondrosarcomas produce a cartilaginous matrix. Cartilage is relatively avascular and the cells grow slowly, making them generally resistant to chemotherapy and radiation (which target rapidly dividing cells). Therefore, wide surgical excision is the primary treatment.",
      "incorrect": {
        "A": "Lymphoma is highly sensitive to both chemotherapy and radiation.",
        "C": "Ewing Sarcoma is highly aggressive but also very sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation.",
        "D": "Multiple Myeloma is a systemic disease treated primarily with chemotherapy/immunotherapy, not wide resection.",
        "E": "While Osteosarcoma requires surgery, it is also treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and treat micrometastases."

      "C": "Osteochondroma",
      "D": "Parosteal Osteosarcoma",
      "E": "Myositis Ossificans"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "E",
    "reasoning": {
      "correct": "This is a benign, reactive bone formation within muscle following trauma. The key diagnostic feature is the Zonation Pattern: the periphery is the most mature (well-formed bone), while the center is immature. This distinguishes it from malignancy.",
      "incorrect": {
        "A": "Polymyositis is an autoimmune inflammatory muscle disease causing weakness, not a bone-forming mass.",
        "B": "Synovial sarcoma is a malignancy showing a biphasic cellular pattern, not bone zonation.",
        "C": "Osteochondroma is a tumor attached to the skeleton (exostosis), not a mass floating within the muscle belly.",
        "D": "Parosteal Osteosarcoma (and Osteosarcoma in general) typically shows the reverse zonation—the center is more mineralized/mature, and the periphery is immature and infiltrative."

  {
    "question": "Microscopic examination of a soft tissue tumor from a child reveals large, eosinophilic cells with abundant cytoplasm, resembling 'strap cells' or 'tadpole cells'. Cross-striations are visible. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "reasoning": {
      "correct": "The description matches Rhabdomyoblasts, which are immature skeletal muscle cells. They often appear as 'strap cells' or 'tadpole cells' with eosinophilic cytoplasm, and the presence of cross-striations (Z-lines) is definitive for skeletal muscle differentiation.",
      "incorrect": {
        "A": "Fibrosarcoma consists of fibroblasts arranged in a 'herringbone' pattern, without eosinophilic cytoplasm or striations.",
        "B": "Leiomyosarcoma (smooth muscle) has spindle cells with blunt-ended 'cigar-shaped' nuclei, not strap cells.",
        "D": "Liposarcoma contains lipoblasts (fat cells) with vacuolated cytoplasm, not muscle striations.",
        "E": "Synovial sarcoma shows a biphasic pattern of epithelial and spindle cells."

    },
    "correctAnswer": "E",

        "A": "Osteochondroma arises from the metaphysis (growth plate area).",
        "B": "Chondroblastoma is an epiphyseal tumor.",
        "C": "Giant Cell Tumor is characteristically found in the epiphysis (end of the bone) usually after the growth plate closes.",

      "B": "Osteosarcoma",
      "C": "Osteoid Osteoma",
      "D": "Chondrosarcoma",
      "E": "Osteochondroma"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "E",
    "reasoning": {
      "correct": "Also known as an Exostosis, this is a benign cartilage-capped bony projection. The key features are the continuity of the marrow space with the parent bone and the direction of growth away from the joint (due to tendon pull).",
      "incorrect": {
        "A": "Enchondroma is a cartilage tumor located inside the medullary cavity (intramedullary), not a projection.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "reasoning": {
      "correct": "Synovial Sarcoma is genetically defined by t(X;18). Histologically, the classic form is biphasic, meaning it contains two distinct cell populations: epithelial cells (forming glands/tubules) and spindle cells (fibroblast-like).",
      "incorrect": {
