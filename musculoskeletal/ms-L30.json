    "question": "A 60-year-old patient with osteoarthritis has been taking Drug A for months and developed a gastric ulcer. The doctor switched him to Drug B to avoid GI toxicity, but warned him about an increased risk of thrombotic events (myocardial infarction). Which of the following correctly identifies the mechanism of Drug B compared to Drug A?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Drug B irreversibly inhibits COX-1, while Drug A inhibits COX-2.",
      "B": "Drug B inhibits Phospholipase A2, whereas Drug A inhibits COX-1 and COX-2.",
      "C": "Drug B selectively inhibits COX-2, preserving TXA2 production while suppressing endothelial PGI2.",
      "D": "Drug B is a non-selective COX inhibitor, whereas Drug A is a selective COX-2 inhibitor.",
      "E": "Drug B inhibits LOX pathway, shifting arachidonic acid metabolism to COX pathway."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "reasoning": {
      "correct": "'Drug A' is likely a traditional non-selective NSAID (like Ibuprofen), which inhibits COX-1 and causes gastric ulcers. 'Drug B' represents a selective COX-2 inhibitor (like Celecoxib), which spares COX-1 (reducing GI risk) but inhibits COX-2-mediated Prostacyclin (PGI2) in blood vessels. Since it does not inhibit platelet Thromboxane A2 (TXA2, which is COX-1 dependent), it creates an imbalance favoring thrombosis, increasing cardiovascular risk.",
      "incorrect": {
        "A": "This describes Aspirin (irreversible COX inhibition), which causes ulcers and is used to prevent thrombosis, not cause it.",
        "B": "Inhibition of Phospholipase A2 is the mechanism of corticosteroids, not NSAIDs/COX-2 inhibitors.",
        "D": "This reverses the drug descriptions. Drug B (the one causing thrombosis risk) is the selective one.",
        "E": "LOX inhibition is not the primary mechanism relevant to the NSAID/COX-2 inhibitor trade-off described."

    "question": "A 35-year-old office worker presents with chronic lower back pain. She has tried taking Paracetamol (1,000 mg) and Ibuprofen (400 mg) for several weeks but the pain persists. According to the WHO analgesic ladder and step-up therapy principles, which of the following drugs is the most appropriate next step?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Morphine",
      "B": "Aspirin",
      "C": "Tramadol",
      "D": "Prednisolone",
      "E": "Methotrexate"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "reasoning": {
      "correct": "The WHO analgesic ladder recommends stepping up from non-opioids (Paracetamol/NSAIDs) to weak opioids for mild-to-moderate pain that persists. Tramadol (or Codeine) is the standard Step 2 choice.",
      "incorrect": {
        "A": "Morphine is a Step 3 strong opioid, reserved for severe pain or when weak opioids fail.",
        "B": "Aspirin is another NSAID (Step 1). Switching between standard NSAIDs usually offers little benefit if one has failed.",
        "D": "Prednisolone is a steroid for inflammatory diseases, not a standard analgesic for mechanical back pain.",
        "E": "Methotrexate is a DMARD for autoimmune conditions like RA, not for general pain relief."
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "question": "Paracetamol and NSAIDs are both antipyretic and analgesic. However, Paracetamol lacks significant anti-inflammatory activity compared to NSAIDs. What is the primary pharmacological difference that explains this observation?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Paracetamol acts primarily in the CNS, having little effect on peripheral COX enzymes.",
      "B": "Paracetamol is rapidly metabolized by the liver before it can reach peripheral tissues.",
      "C": "Paracetamol inhibits Phospholipase C, whereas NSAIDs inhibit Cyclooxygenase.",
      "D": "NSAIDs bind irreversibly to plasma proteins, displacing Paracetamol from the site of action.",
      "E": "Paracetamol is a weak opioid agonist, while NSAIDs are prostaglandin inhibitors."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "reasoning": {
      "correct": "Paracetamol acts centrally (in the CNS) to reduce pain and fever, likely via COX-3 inhibition or serotonergic pathways. It has very weak activity against COX enzymes in peripheral tissues (sites of inflammation), explaining why it reduces fever/pain but not inflammation.",
      "incorrect": {
        "B": "Paracetamol distributes widely; its lack of peripheral effect is due to enzyme sensitivity, not metabolism preventing distribution.",
        "C": "Both affect COX pathways (though isoforms differ); Paracetamol does not inhibit Phospholipase C.",
        "D": "This is a pharmacokinetic theory that does not explain the pharmacodynamic difference in inflammation.",
        "E": "Paracetamol is not an opioid agonist."

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "reasoning": {
      "correct": "Reye’s Syndrome is a severe condition causing encephalopathy (confusion) and liver failure. It is strongly associated with using Aspirin (salicylates) in children with viral infections (like Influenza or Chickenpox).",
      "incorrect": {
        "A": "Steven-Johnson Syndrome is a severe skin reaction (rash/blistering), not primarily liver/brain failure.",
        "C": "Serotonin Syndrome involves tremors and autonomic instability from serotonergic drugs.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "reasoning": {
      "correct": "Celecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor. Selective COX-2 inhibition tips the balance towards thrombosis (by lowering PGI2 but not TXA2), significantly increasing cardiovascular risk (MI/Stroke). It should be avoided in patients with CV history.",
      "incorrect": {
        "A": "Naproxen is non-selective and has the lowest cardiovascular risk profile among NSAIDs.",
        "B": "Ibuprofen carries some risk but less than highly selective COX-2 inhibitors.",
        "C": "Aspirin is cardioprotective at low doses.",
        "E": "Paracetamol has no significant cardiovascular risk, so it wouldn't be the drug to 'strictly avoid' for this reason."

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "reasoning": {
      "correct": "Methyl Salicylate and Menthol work as Counterirritants (Rubefacients). They irritate sensory nerve endings to alter pain perception (masking deep pain with surface sensation).",
      "incorrect": {
        "A": "Local anesthetics (like Lidocaine) cause numbness, not burning/cooling sensations.",

    "question": "Opioids are considered the most potent analgesics for severe pain. Unlike NSAIDs which act peripherally, why do opioids provide such profound analgesia?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "They inhibit the release of Histamine and Bradykinin in the periphery only.",
      "B": "They block voltage-gated sodium channels in the nerve axon.",
      "C": "They bind to Mu-receptors located in the CNS (brain), spinal cord (dorsal horn), and peripheral tissues, modulating pain at multiple levels.",
      "D": "They induce amnesia so the patient forgets the pain.",
      "E": "They completely sever the connection between afferent and efferent neurons."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "reasoning": {
      "correct": "Opioids act on Mu-opioid receptors found in the brain, spinal cord, and periphery. By acting centrally (reducing pain perception/reaction) and spinally (blocking transmission), they are more potent than drugs acting only peripherally.",
      "incorrect": {
        "A": "This mechanism is more relevant to antihistamines.",
        "B": "This is the mechanism of local anesthetics.",
