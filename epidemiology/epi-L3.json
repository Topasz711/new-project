            "A": "Using a single data source is sufficient.",
            "B": "It is not necessary to assess the quality of the included studies.",
            "C": "Use at least 2 data sources, such as Scopus and PubMed.",
            "D": "Statistical methods should not be used, as it is only a narrative summary.",
            "E": "Clear selection criteria are not needed."

        "correctAnswer": "C",
        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "A fundamental principle of a systematic and comprehensive literature search is to use multiple databases to minimize selection bias and ensure the search is as complete as possible. The lecture notes state one 'should search for reference information from more than one data source'.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "Relying on a single database can lead to missing important studies, violating the systematic nature of the review.",
                "B": "Assessing the quality (or risk of bias) of each individual study is a critical step in any systematic review or meta-analysis.",
                "D": "A meta-analysis is, by definition, a statistical analysis that combines results from multiple studies. A narrative summary without statistics is a traditional literature review.",
                "E": "A systematic review is defined by its rigorous methodology, which requires clear, pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria."
