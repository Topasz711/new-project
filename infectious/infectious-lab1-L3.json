The mosquito holds its body in a straight line (a single axis) at approximately a 45-degree angle to the surface of the skin. This is a classic identifying feature of the Anopheles genus."

                },
                "reasoning": "Answer: The breeding places are typically clean, unpolluted, and slow-moving or standing water bodies. These can include a wide variety of natural habitats such as streams, rock pools, animal footprints, seepage water, rice paddies, and even brackish water.\n\nReason: The eggs shown are boat-shaped and equipped with lateral floats, which is a key characteristic of Anopheles eggs. Females of this genus lay their eggs singly on the surface of the water in these types of preferred aquatic environments.\n\nTopaz's Note: ถ้าตอบใกล้เคียงก็ tick ว่าตัวเองถูกได้เลยนะ ไม่รู้จะ code ยังไงดีในมันครอบคลุมคำตอบ"

                "answer": ["Causes Paederus dermatitis"],
                "reasoning": "The medical importance of the Rove beetle is not as a vector, but as a direct cause of injury. Its hemolymph (blood) contains pederin, a potent vesicant toxin. When a person crushes or brushes the beetle against their skin, the toxin is released, causing a severe chemical irritation known as Paederus dermatitis."

                "reasoning": "The primary medical importance relates to the cutaneous and allergic reactions from their bites, the risk of secondary bacterial infections from scratching, and significant psychological distress. They are not considered competent vectors for disease transmission to humans.\n\nTopaz's Note: ถ้าตอบใกล้เคียงก็ tick ว่าตัวเองถูกได้เลยนะ ไม่รู้จะ code ยังไงดีในมันครอบคลุมคำตอบ แถมข้อนี้ไม่รู้จะถามอะไรได้บ้าง เก็งไว้มั่ว ๆ"
