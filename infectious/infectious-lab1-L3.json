            "correct": "The egg of Schistosoma haematobium has a very distinct morphology: a large, oval-shaped egg (approximately 110-170 Âµm long) with a sharp, prominent terminal spine at one end. These eggs are typically found in urine.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "The egg of S. japonicum is smaller, more rounded, and has a very small, inconspicuous lateral knob or spine. It is found in stool.",

                "D": "Clonorchis sinensis is a liver fluke, not a blood fluke. Its eggs are much smaller, operculated (have a lid), and are shaped like a light bulb.",
                "E": "The egg of S. mansoni is large and oval but is distinguished by a large and prominent lateral spine protruding from the side, not the end. It is found in stool."

What finding would confirm the parasite is Taenia saginata?",

            "correct": "The most reliable method for differentiating the species from a gravid proglottid is counting the primary lateral uterine branches. Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm) is characterized by having a large number, typically 15 to 20 or more, on each side.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "Fewer than 15 (typically 7-13) lateral uterine branches is the characteristic feature of Taenia solium (pork tapeworm).",

                "D": "This feature applies to the scolex (head), not the proglottid. T. saginata lacks a rostellum and hooks, while T. solium has them. The scolex is rarely passed in the stool.",

        "question": "A report on intestinal parasites in an orphanage noted a high prevalence of an infection diagnosed by finding eggs with a hexacanth embryo, polar filaments, and hooks.

            "correct": "The egg of Hymenolepis nana (dwarf tapeworm) uniquely has a six-hooked embryo (hexacanth) with polar filaments arising from the poles of its inner membrane. Furthermore, it is the most common tapeworm and can be transmitted directly from person to person via the fecal-oral route, making it highly transmissible in crowded environments like orphanages.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "Taenia spp. eggs have a hexacanth embryo but lack polar filaments. Transmission is via undercooked meat, not person-to-person.",
                "B": "Ascaris lumbricoides is a roundworm with large, bumpy (mammillated) eggs lacking hooks or filaments.",
                "C": "Hymenolepis diminuta (rat tapeworm) eggs look similar to H. nana but are distinguished by the absence of polar filaments. Its life cycle requires an insect intermediate host.",

            "incorrect": {
                "A": "For Taenia saginata, humans are the definitive host, and cattle are the sole intermediate host.",

            "correct": "The combination of findings is classic for diphyllobothriasis (fish tapeworm). The key diagnostic feature is megaloblastic anemia caused by Vitamin B12 deficiency, as the large worm in the small intestine absorbs the host's dietary B12. The eggs are also characteristically operculated.",

            "A": "There is no difference; all are transmitted by eating any raw freshwater organism.",
