Based on the Lwoff's classification scheme outlined in the provided lecture notes, only the Poxviridae family fits this description, as it is the only DNA virus family that replicates in the cytoplasm and has a complex structure. This family includes viruses like Smallpox virus and Monkeypox virus.",

Key symptoms and signs include high fever, retro-orbital pain, severe myalgia ('break-bone fever'), a maculopapular rash, and a positive tourniquet test. Laboratory findings of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are also characteristic of Dengue fever. The causative agent, Dengue virus, belongs to the family Flaviviridae.",

The presence of EBV DNA by PCR in an HIV-positive patient is strongly associated with the development of Burkitt’s lymphoma.

Measles virus belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae. The initial site of infection and replication is in the respiratory epithelial cells, which then spreads to lymphoid tissues and eventually throughout the body. The presence of multinucleated giant cells (syncytia) in nasopharyngeal secretions is a characteristic cytopathic effect of Measles virus.",

            "correct": "The clinical presentation of a painful, vesicular rash in a dermatomal distribution on the thorax is characteristic of Herpes Zoster (Shingles). This condition is caused by the reactivation of latent Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV), which is the same virus that causes chickenpox. After the initial chickenpox infection, VZV establishes a lifelong latent infection in the dorsal root ganglia (sensory neurons). Reactivation typically occurs later in life, often due to a decline in cell-mediated immunity (as may happen with age or chemotherapy).",
