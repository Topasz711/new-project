        "question": "The cell membranes of fungi are a primary target for several antifungal agents because they contain a unique sterol not found in human cells. What is this key sterol?",

        "correctAnswer": "B",
        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "Ergosterol is the principal sterol in the fungal cell membrane. Its unique presence in fungi makes it an excellent target for antifungal drugs like amphotericin B and the azole group, which inhibit its synthesis or function.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "Cholesterol is the primary sterol found in human cell membranes, not fungal membranes.",
                "C": "Lanosterol is a precursor molecule in the synthesis pathway of both ergosterol and cholesterol; it is not the final, unique sterol.",
                "D": "This is a type of phytosterol, a sterol found in plants, not fungi.",
                "E": "Zymosterol is another intermediate in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway but is not the final functional component of the fungal cell membrane."

        "question": "The term 'Hyaline mold' refers to a specific characteristic of the fungal hyphae. What does this term describe?",
        "choices": {
            "A": "The presence of regular cross-walls or septa",
            "B": "The absence of cross-walls, resulting in coenocytic hyphae",

        "correctAnswer": "D",
        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "Fungal hyphae are classified by their color into two groups: hyaline (lightly colored) and dematiaceous (darkly colored). Examples of hyaline molds include Aspergillus and Dermatophytes.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "This describes septate hyphae, which is a classification based on internal structure, not color.",
                "B": "This describes aseptate or non-septate hyphae.",
                "C": "This describes dematiaceous mold, also known as black mold.",

        "question": "A patient presents with thickened, discolored toenails. A KOH prep of a nail clipping reveals long, branching filaments that break up into individual cells. This method of asexual reproduction, involving the fragmentation of septate hyphae, produces which type of conidia?",

        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "Arthroconidia are asexual conidia formed by the simple fragmentation of pre-existing hyphae into individual cells. This is a characteristic feature of dermatophytes, the fungi that cause onychomycosis (nail infections).",

                "A": "Blastoconidia are asexual spores produced by budding from a mother cell, characteristic of yeasts like Candida.",

                "D": "While dermatophytes produce microconidia, these are small spores borne off the sides of hyphae, not formed by fragmentation of the hypha itself.",
                "E": "These are asexual spores produced inside a sac-like sporangium, typical of Zygomycetes like Rhizopus."
