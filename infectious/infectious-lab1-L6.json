                "reasoning": "<b>Answer:</b> Throat swab, nasal swab, nasopharyngeal swab/aspirate, saliva, oral swab<br><b>Rationale:</b> For respiratory viral infections like COVID-19, the virus primarily replicates in the upper respiratory tract. Therefore, the most suitable specimens are those collected from the nasopharynx and oropharynx (throat and nasal passages), as these sites will have the highest viral load during the acute phase of infection.<br><i>Topaz's Note: ถ้าตอบใกล้เคียงก็ tick ว่าตัวเองถูกได้เลยนะ ไม่รู้จะ code ยังไงดีในมันครอบคลุมคำตอบ</i>"

                "reasoning": "<b>Rationale:</b> The control line (C) serves as an internal quality control to confirm the test is working correctly; it must appear for any result to be valid. The test line (T) only appears if it detects the viral antigen. In a negative result, no viral antigen is detected, so the T line will not appear, leaving only the C line visible."

It should not be frozen.<br><b>Rationale:</b> For viral genomic sequencing, it is crucial to preserve the integrity of the virus. Viral Transport Medium (VTM) is specifically designed to maintain viral viability. Transporting the sample at 4°C (refrigerated) slows down viral degradation without the damaging effects of freezing.<br><i>Topaz's Note: ถ้าตอบใกล้เคียงก็ tick ว่าตัวเองถูกได้เลยนะ ไม่รู้จะ code ยังไงดีในมันครอบคลุมคำตอบ</i>"
