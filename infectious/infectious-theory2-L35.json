            "A": "Terbinafine",
            "B": "Itraconazole",
            "C": "Fluconazole",

        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "The patient is experiencing a disulfiram-like reaction, which occurs when alcohol is consumed with certain medications. Griseofulvin is known to cause this specific adverse effect.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "Terbinafine's main adverse effects include hepatic toxicity and GI upset; it is not associated with a disulfiram-like reaction.",
                "B": "Azoles like Itraconazole are associated with GI upset and hepatotoxicity, but not a disulfiram-like reaction.",
                "C": "Azoles like Fluconazole are associated with GI upset and hepatotoxicity, but not a disulfiram-like reaction.",
                "D": "Amphotericin B is an IV drug for severe systemic infections, not oral for onychomycosis. Its main toxicities are infusion-related reactions and nephrotoxicity."

        "question": "A patient is prescribed oral ketoconazole. Co-administration of which drug would most likely lead to reduced absorption and decreased efficacy of the antifungal agent?",

            "A": "Acetaminophen for fever",
            "B": "A high-fat meal",

        "correctAnswer": "C",
        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "The absorption of certain azoles, including ketoconazole, requires an acidic gastric environment. Proton-pump inhibitors, which reduce stomach acid, will decrease the absorption of these drugs.",

                "A": "Acetaminophen is not known to affect the absorption of azole antifungals.",
                "B": "A high-fat meal is noted to increase the absorption of Griseofulvin, not decrease the absorption of ketoconazole.",
                "D": "Acidic beverages, such as carbonated drinks, are stated to enhance the oral absorption of azoles.",

        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "Caspofungin is an echinocandin that works by inhibiting Î²-glucan synthase, a key component of the fungal cell wall. This class is effective against azole-resistant Candida species and has a favorable safety profile, making it a good choice for patients with renal insufficiency.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "Fluconazole is an azole and may be ineffective against a resistant C. glabrata strain. It targets the cell membrane, not the cell wall.",
                "B": "Voriconazole is an azole and may be ineffective. It also targets the cell membrane.",
                "C": "Amphotericin B deoxycholate is highly associated with renal toxicity and would be a poor choice for a patient with pre-existing renal insufficiency.",
                "D": "Flucytosine is never used as a monotherapy due to the rapid development of resistance and does not target the cell wall."

                "A": "Griseofulvin is listed as a '2nd line treatment of dermatophytosis', making it an alternative but not the initial drug of choice.",

                "C": "While some azoles have activity, they are not identified as the first-line therapy for onychomycosis.",
                "D": "While some azoles have activity, they are not identified as the first-line therapy. Systemic ketoconazole is particularly avoided due to its side effect profile."
