        "correctAnswer": "C",
        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "This is incorrect. Staphylococcus aureus is a Risk Group 2 pathogen. It can cause human disease, but effective treatment is available, and community risk is low. Therefore, it is handled under Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) conditions. BSL-3 is for Risk Group 3 agents like M. tuberculosis that pose a high individual risk of aerosol transmission.",

                "A": "This is correct. Ebola virus is a Risk Group 4 agent requiring the maximum containment of BSL-4.",
                "B": "This is correct. M. tuberculosis is a Risk Group 3 agent transmitted via inhalation that requires BSL-3.",
                "D": "This is correct. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a Risk Group 1 agent not known to cause disease in healthy humans, requiring only BSL-1.",
                "E": "This is correct. Measles virus is a common pathogen (Risk Group 2) for which preventive measures exist, appropriately handled at BSL-2."

        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "This option correctly follows the established hierarchy: 1. Bacterial spores (II) are the most resistant. 2. Mycobacteria (I) are next due to their waxy cell wall. 3. Fungi (IV) have moderate resistance. 4. Lipid (enveloped) viruses (III) are the least resistant because the lipid envelope is easily disrupted.",

        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "The description suggests a spore-forming organism like Clostridioides difficile. Bacterial spores are extremely resistant. Autoclaving uses pressurized steam to achieve 121°C, a sterilization method capable of destroying all microorganisms, including spores, making it the most reliable method.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "Boiling is disinfection, not sterilization, and does not reliably destroy all bacterial spores.",

                "D": "While dry heat is a sterilization method, 210°C is unnecessarily high and could damage the item; autoclaving is more standard.",
