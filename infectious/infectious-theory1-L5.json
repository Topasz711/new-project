        "question": "In the complex life cycle of Plasmodium species, humans are the intermediate host. Which organism serves as the definitive host, where the sexual reproduction (sporogony) phase of the parasite's life cycle occurs?",
        "choices": {
            "A": "Male Anopheles mosquito",
            "B": "Female Anopheles mosquito",
            "C": "Humans",

        "correctAnswer": "B",
        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "The definitive host is the organism where the parasite's sexual reproduction occurs. For Plasmodium species, the sexual reproduction phase (sporogonic cycle) takes place inside the female Anopheles mosquito after she ingests gametocytes from an infected human's blood.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "Male mosquitoes are not involved in the transmission of malaria because they feed on plant nectars, not blood.",
                "C": "Humans are the intermediate host for the malaria parasite. This is where asexual reproduction (exo-erythrocytic and erythrocytic schizogony) takes place.",
                "D": "While some species of malaria, like P. knowlesi, can infect primates, the primates serve as intermediate hosts. The definitive host remains the mosquito vector.",
                "E": "Birds are hosts for different species of avian malaria, which have their own life cycles and are not part of the life cycle for human malaria parasites."

        "question": "Relapses in malaria infections, which can occur weeks or months after the initial illness has resolved, are a characteristic feature of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale. This phenomenon is due to the presence of a dormant parasite stage in the liver. What is this stage called?",
        "choices": {
            "A": "Sporozoite",
            "B": "Merozoite",

        },
        "correctAnswer": "E",
        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "The hypnozoite is a dormant stage of the parasite that can remain in liver cells for weeks, months, or even years. Its name comes from the Greek hypnos, meaning 'sleep.' When these hypnozoites reactivate, they cause a new wave of infection, leading to a relapse. This feature is unique to Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "The sporozoite is the active, motile stage injected by the mosquito that travels to the liver; it is not the dormant stage itself.",
                "B": "Merozoites are released from ruptured schizonts and are responsible for invading red blood cells to continue the cycle, not for dormancy.",
                "C": "A hepatic schizont is the stage of active asexual replication within a liver cell, the opposite of a dormant stage.",
                "D": "Gametocytes are the sexual stages that circulate in the bloodstream to be picked up by mosquitoes; they do not cause relapses in the human host."

        "question": "A 35-year-old veterinarian gives birth to a newborn diagnosed with hydrocephalus. A brain MRI reveals intracranial calcifications, and an eye exam shows retinochoroiditis. The mother recalls having mild, flu-like symptoms with swollen lymph nodes in her neck during the first trimester. What is the most likely causative organism and the infective stage responsible for the congenital infection?",
        "choices": {
            "A": "Plasmodium falciparum; Sporozoite",

        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "The newborn's symptoms—hydrocephalus, intracranial calcifications, and retinochoroiditis—are the 'Classical Triads' of congenital toxoplasmosis. The tachyzoite is the rapidly multiplying stage found in body fluids during an acute infection, which allows it to cross the placenta and infect the fetus.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "Plasmodium falciparum causes malaria; its congenital form does not present with this triad, and the sporozoite does not cross the placenta.",
                "B": "Taenia solium causes neurocysticercosis, which does not match the full congenital triad described.",
                "C": "Acanthamoeba spp. is a free-living amoeba and is not a cause of this congenital syndrome.",
                "D": "While the mother could acquire the infection by ingesting bradyzoites, the bradyzoite is the slow, encysted stage. It transforms into tachyzoites in the mother, and it is the tachyzoites that cross the placenta."

            "incorrect": {
                "A": "P. falciparum causes a more irregular fever, infects normal-sized RBCs, and features Maurer's clefts, not Schüffner's dots.",

                "D": "P. ovale shares the 48-hour cycle and Schüffner's dots, but its infected RBCs are characteristically oval-shaped and the trophozoites are more compact.",
