        "choices": {
            "A": "High abundance and low diversity, dominated by Lactobacillus species.",
            "B": "The presence of Gardnerella vaginalis and Candida albicans as the codominant species.",
            "C": "High abundance and high diversity, including various species of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria.",
            "D": "Low abundance and high diversity, with a significant presence of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes.",

        "correctAnswer": "A",
        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "This pattern is the hallmark of a healthy lower genital tract (LGT). A Lactobacillus-dominated state leads to high abundance but low diversity. These bacteria produce lactic acid, which maintains a low vaginal pH and inhibits the growth of pathogens.",
            "incorrect": {
                "B": "The overgrowth of Gardnerella vaginalis and Candida albicans is a sign of dysbiosis, leading to conditions like bacterial vaginosis or vaginal candidiasis.",
                "C": "A healthy vaginal microbiome is characterized by its low diversity and the clear dominance of a single genus, Lactobacillus.",
                "D": "Low abundance and high diversity are characteristic patterns of the upper genital tract (UGT), not the healthy LGT.",

            "correct": "Staphylococcus epidermidis is a prime example of resident microbiota. It is a dominant member of the skin flora, making up as much as 90% of the aerobic bacteria present.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "Candida albicans is a fungus that can be found on the skin, but S. epidermidis is the specific bacterium highlighted as the key example of resident flora.",
                "B": "Escherichia coli is a hallmark of the gastrointestinal tract and is not considered normal resident microbiota of the skin.",

        "correctAnswer": "D",
        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "The overgrowth of Clostridioides difficile is linked to antibiotic therapy. C. difficile produces toxins that cause severe epithelial damage, leading to the formation of pseudomembranous colitis, which matches the endoscopic findings described.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "Salmonella enterica is an exogenous pathogen that causes gastroenteritis through infection, not typically by overgrowing after antibiotic therapy.",

            "correct": "This choice accurately reflects the fundamental definitions. Probiotics are defined as 'Live bacteria' with beneficial effects. Prebiotics are defined as 'Non-digestible food' (like fiber) that serves as food for beneficial bacteria, stimulating their growth.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "This confuses definitions with specific, and not exclusive, applications.",
