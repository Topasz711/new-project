        "question": "A patient presents with a painless chancre on the genitals. Several weeks later, they develop a maculopapular rash on the palms and soles. If untreated, this can progress to affect the cardiovascular and nervous systems. Which organism is responsible?",

        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "This is the causative agent of syphilis. The disease progression perfectly matches the case: a primary stage with a painless genital ulcer (chancre), followed by a secondary stage with a maculopapular rash that classically appears on the palms and soles, and an untreated tertiary stage that can lead to severe cardiovascular and neurological problems.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "This organism causes leptospirosis, an acute febrile illness, not the distinct stages of a chancre followed by a rash on the palms and soles.",
                "B": "This spirochete causes tick-borne relapsing fever, characterized by recurring episodes of high fever, not the specific clinical progression described.",
                "C": "This organism causes Lyme disease, which typically begins with an erythema migrans ('bull's-eye') rash, not a painless chancre.",
                "D": "This organism causes yaws, a non-venereal disease that primarily affects the skin, bones, and joints and does not begin with a genital chancre."

        "question": "A 65-year-old smoker with COPD is hospitalized with pneumonia, high fever, a dry cough, headache, and confusion. Lab tests show hyponatremia. He attended a convention at a large hotel with decorative fountains two weeks prior. A special culture on buffered charcoal yeast extract (BCYE) agar is ordered. Which organism is suspected?",

        "correctAnswer": "B",
        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "This organism causes Legionnaires' disease. The epidemiology fits perfectly (transmitted via aerosols from water sources). The clinical picture of severe pneumonia with headache and confusion in an at-risk patient is classic. The requirement for a special culture medium like BCYE agar is also characteristic.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "This causes atypical pneumonia but is not associated with contaminated environmental water sources and does not require BCYE agar.",
                "C": "This is a common cause of typical pneumonia and would be readily grown on standard blood agar.",
                "D": "This organism causes atypical pneumonia but is transmitted from person to person, not from contaminated water systems.",

        "question": "A 15-year-old student presents with a persistent, non-productive cough, low-grade fever, and malaise for two weeks. A chest X-ray reveals patchy infiltrates, appearing more severe than the clinical symptoms suggest. A Gram stain of the sputum shows mononuclear cells but no visible bacteria. This presentation suggests 'walking pneumonia' caused by which organism?",

        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "This organism is a classic cause of atypical ('walking') pneumonia, especially in the 5-15 year old age range. A key diagnostic feature is that it lacks a cell wall, meaning it will not be visible on a Gram stain, which matches the lab findings. The insidious onset of symptoms also fits the description.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "This is another cause of 'walking' pneumonia, but Mycoplasma pneumoniae is an especially common cause in the 5-15 year old age group.",
                "B": "This typically causes a more severe pneumonia (Legionnaires' disease), not the milder 'walking pneumonia' common in teenagers.",
                "C": "This organism is primarily associated with infections of the genitourinary tract, not respiratory infections.",

            "correct": "This Gram-negative coccobacillus is the most common pathogen found in wound infections from cat and dog bites. Infections are known for their extremely rapid onset (typically within 24 hours) and progression to cellulitis, which perfectly describes the case. It is also characteristically sensitive to penicillin.",

            "incorrect": {
                "B": "This causes tularemia. While it can cause swollen lymph nodes, the classic presentation of a large, extremely painful bubo linked to a die-off of prairie dogs is more specific to plague.",
