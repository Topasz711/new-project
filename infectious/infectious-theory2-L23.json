        "question": "A patient presents with a severe skin infection that has rapidly progressed over the past 24 hours. The area is swollen, discolored, and upon palpation, a crackling sensation (crepitus) is felt. A Gram stain from the wound exudate reveals large, 'boxcar-shaped' Gram-positive bacilli with very few spores. The organism is cultured anaerobically and shows a characteristic double zone of beta-hemolysis on blood agar. Which organism is responsible?",
        "choices": {
            "A": "Streptococcus pyogenes",

            "correct": "The clinical presentation of a rapidly progressing infection with swelling and crepitus (gas in the tissue) is the hallmark of gas gangrene. The laboratory findings perfectly match C. perfringens: it is a large, Gram-positive bacillus that is cultured anaerobically and famously produces a double zone of hemolysis on blood agar due to its alpha toxin.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "Streptococcus pyogenes is a Gram-positive coccus, not a bacillus. While it can cause severe necrotizing fasciitis, it does not typically produce gas.",
                "B": "Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae causes a more localized and less aggressive skin infection called erysipeloid and does not produce gas. It is also catalase-negative.",
                "D": "Bacillus anthracis, in its cutaneous form, typically causes a painless black eschar, not gas gangrene. It is an aerobe and is non-hemolytic on blood agar.",
                "E": "Clostridium tetani's primary pathology is toxin-mediated tetanus (spastic paralysis); it does not cause a destructive, gas-producing tissue infection."

The combination of being a spore-forming, catalase-positive bacillus that is uniquely non-motile and produces non-hemolytic colonies is the definitive laboratory profile for Bacillus anthracis. The colony morphology described is also characteristic.",
