        "question": "An elderly patient from a rural nursing home with a large, untreated leg ulcer is brought to the emergency department. The ulcer is foul-smelling, and upon examination, numerous worm-like organisms are seen moving within the necrotic tissue. Which of the following terms best describes this condition?",

            "A": "Scabies",
            "B": "Dermatitis",

        "correctAnswer": "E",
        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "Myiasis is the specific medical term for the infestation of live vertebrate tissue by fly larvae (maggots). The clinical picture of 'worm-like organisms' moving in a necrotic wound is the classic presentation of wound myiasis.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "This is an infestation by the microscopic mite Sarcoptes scabiei, which burrows into the skin and is not visible as moving worms.",
                "B": "This is a general term for skin inflammation. 'Myiasis' is the more precise diagnosis for the infestation itself.",
                "C": "This is an infestation of lice, which live on hair or in clothing, not inside wounds.",
                "D": "This is a disease caused by internal roundworms transmitted by vectors like mosquitoes, not involving larvae in an open skin ulcer."

        "question": "A college student camping in a forest accidentally crushes an insect on their arm. The next day, the area develops a large, painful blister. The insect was noted to be black and yellow. Based on the presentation, what is the most likely toxin responsible for the lesion?",

        "correctAnswer": "E",
        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "Cantharidin is a potent blistering agent produced by blister beetles (Family Meloidae). Many species, such as Mylabris spp., are black and yellow. Contact with the beetle's body fluids upon crushing it causes the characteristic formation of large skin blisters.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "This is a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction, not the primary toxin from the insect itself.",
                "B": "A component of ant venom, which causes a sharp, burning sensation but not large blisters.",
                "C": "This is the main toxin in bee venom, which is injected via a sting.",
                "D": "This toxin is from rove beetles (Paederus spp.) and typically causes linear or 'kissing' lesions, not a single large blister."

            "correct": "The key identifying feature is the barbed stinger left in the skin. Honeybees (Family Apidae) are unique among these choices for having a barbed stinger that lodges in the victim's skin, tearing away from the bee along with the venom sac.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "Fire ants bite and sting, but their stinger is smooth and is not left behind.",
                "B": "Yellow Jackets have smooth, unbarbed stingers and can sting repeatedly.",
