        "question": "A 25-year-old immunocompetent male presents with an intensely itchy rash characterized by serpentine burrows, papules, and vesicles, particularly in the interdigital spaces of his hands, wrists, and elbows. He reports that the itching is worse at night. The condition is most likely Scabiasis. How is this condition primarily transmitted, and what is its causative agent?",
        "choices": {
            "A": "Transmission is via respiratory droplets; the agent is a virus.",
            "B": "Transmission is via contaminated food or water; the agent is a bacterium.",
            "C": "Transmission is via the bite of an infected insect vector; the agent is a protozoan.",
            "D": "Transmission is via inhalation of allergens; the agent is the house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus.",
            "E": "Transmission is via direct, prolonged skin-to-skin contact; the agent is the burrowing mite Sarcoptes scabiei."

        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "The clinical presentation of intense itching that worsens at night, along with serpentine burrows in skin folds, is classic for scabies. This disease is caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei, which burrows into the skin. The primary mode of transmission is through direct, prolonged skin-to-skin contact.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "Scabies is a parasitic skin infestation, not a viral illness transmitted through respiratory droplets.",
                "B": "Scabies is not a bacterial infection and is not transmitted through the fecal-oral route.",
                "C": "In scabies, the mite itself is the cause of the disease (infestation), not a vector transmitting a separate protozoan pathogen.",
                "D": "The house dust mite, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, causes respiratory allergies, not scabies."

        "question": "An elderly patient in a nursing home, who is immunocompromised due to long-term corticosteroid use, develops thick, crusted lesions on their hands and feet, with minimal itching. A skin scraping reveals a massive number of mites and eggs. Based on the presentation and patient history, what is the most likely diagnosis and causative agent?",
        "choices": {

        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "Norwegian (Crusted) Scabiasis is a severe form of scabies that occurs in immunocompromised individuals. Due to the poor immune response, the mites (Sarcoptes scabiei) reproduce unchecked, leading to a massive infestation and thick, hyperkeratotic crusts on the skin. A critical clue is that itching may be minimal or absent.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "Pediculosis corporis is an infestation of body lice and does not cause thick, crusted lesions.",

                "C": "Demodex are follicle mites that cause localized skin inflammation like folliculitis or rosacea, not widespread, crusted hyperkeratosis.",
                "D": "Scrub typhus is a systemic bacterial infection transmitted by chigger mites, presenting with fever and an eschar, not crusted skin filled with mites."

        "question": "A college student studying late at night near an open window feels a small insect on their arm and instinctively crushes it.

Which arthropod and associated medical condition is the most likely cause?",

        "correctAnswer": "B",
        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "This is a classic presentation of Paederus dermatitis. Rove beetles, attracted to light, do not bite or sting. When crushed on the skin, they release a potent toxin called pederin, which causes a linear chemical burn with blistering. A 'kissing lesion' occurs when the toxin is transferred to an adjacent skin surface.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "A centipede bite results in a puncture wound, not a linear lesion from crushing.",

        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "Passive envenomation is the transfer of venom without the deliberate action of the creature. This perfectly describes the Rove beetle, which does not bite or sting. Envenomation occurs when the beetle is accidentally crushed, releasing the pederin toxin from its body fluid.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "Biological transmission involves a pathogen developing inside the vector. The Rove beetle's effect is a direct chemical burn from a toxin.",
                "B": "Active envenomation via a stinger is characteristic of bees and wasps.",
                "D": "Mechanical transmission is the simple transport of pathogens, whereas the Rove beetle causes direct toxic injury.",

        "question": "During a survey of potential mosquito breeding sites, a public health inspector finds clusters of dark, elongated eggs laid together to form a raft floating on the surface of a ditch containing stagnant, polluted water. This morphology is characteristic of which mosquito genus, and what is its primary medical importance in this context?",

Culex mosquitoes lay their eggs in rafts that float on the water's surface and are known for breeding in stagnant, polluted water. In this context, their primary medical importance is as the vector for Japanese B Encephalitis.",

The area has extensive rice cultivation and numerous pig farms. The water in the rice paddies and ditches is stagnant and rich in organic matter. Based on this ecological information, which mosquito is the most likely vector for the disease, and what disease is it likely transmitting?",
        "choices": {
            "A": "Anopheles spp., transmitting Malaria.",
            "B": "Aedes spp., transmitting Dengue fever.",

The breeding habitat (stagnant, organic-rich water like rice paddies) and the presence of pigs (the primary amplifying hosts for the JBE virus) are critical clues. The disease presentation (febrile illness with neurological symptoms) is also classic for severe JBE.",

                "A": "Malaria does not typically present as an outbreak with primarily neurological symptoms.",
                "B": "Aedes mosquitoes prefer clean water in containers, and Dengue fever is characterized by severe body aches, not primarily neurological symptoms.",
                "D": "Mansonia transmit Brugian filariasis, a chronic lymphatic disease, not an acute febrile illness.",
