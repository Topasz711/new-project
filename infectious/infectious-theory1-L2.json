        "question": "A 55-year-old man from a rural community in Southeast Asia presents with a one-week history of migratory, subcutaneous, erythematous swellings on his abdomen and chest. He recalls eating a local delicacy of raw freshwater fish ('koi pla') about two weeks prior. A complete blood count reveals significant eosinophilia. What is the most probable causative agent?",
        "choices": {
            "A": "Gnathostoma spinigerum",
            "B": "Strongyloides stercoralis",

        },
        "correctAnswer": "A",
        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "The clinical presentation is classic for gnathostomiasis. The key features are the combination of migratory subcutaneous swellings (cutaneous larva migrans), a history of eating raw freshwater fish (the primary mode of transmission), significant eosinophilia, and the endemic location in Southeast Asia.",
            "incorrect": {
                "B": "Strongyloidiasis is acquired when larvae in soil penetrate the skin. It does not cause large, migratory swellings and is not acquired from eating raw fish.",
                "C": "Trichinosis is acquired by eating raw or undercooked meat (usually pork), not fish. Classic symptoms include muscle pain and periorbital edema.",
                "D": "Lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis) is transmitted by mosquito bites and affects the lymphatic system, causing chronic lymphedema, not acute migratory swellings.",
                "E": "Angiostrongylus cantonensis (rat lungworm) is acquired from raw snails or slugs and primarily causes eosinophilic meningitis, not skin manifestations."

            "A": "The body nuclei of B. malayi are typically overlapping and uncountable, while those of W. bancrofti are discrete and countable.",
            "B": "W. bancrofti has two terminal nuclei in its tail, while B. malayi has none.",
            "C": "W. bancrofti has no nuclei in the tip of its tail, whereas B. malayi has two distinct terminal nuclei.",
            "D": "W. bancrofti lacks a sheath, whereas B. malayi is sheathed.",
            "E": "The cephalic space of W. bancrofti is longer than its width, while it is of equal length and width in B. malayi."
        },
        "correctAnswer": "C",
        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "This is the most definitive feature. The tail of Wuchereria bancrofti is pointed and the column of nuclei does not extend to the very tip. In contrast, the tail of Brugia malayi contains two separate, distinct nuclei at the tip.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "While generally true that W. bancrofti nuclei are more discrete, it is not the key or most reliable difference compared to the tail nuclei morphology.",
                "B": "This statement is the exact opposite of the correct fact; it incorrectly swaps the characteristics of the two species.",
                "D": "This is incorrect. Both Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi are sheathed microfilariae.",
                "E": "This statement reverses the actual description. The cephalic space of W. bancrofti has a length roughly equal to its width (1:1 ratio), while in B. malayi, it is typically twice as long as it is wide (2:1 ratio)."

            "correct": "The presentation indicates an infection with Ascaris lumbricoides (giant roundworm). The non-productive cough suggests larval migration through the lungs (Loeffler's syndrome). Ascaris is a soil-transmitted helminth, and infection occurs when a person ingests food, water, or soil contaminated with infective embryonated eggs.",

            "incorrect": {

                "C": "Intestinal obstruction by a tangled mass of worms is a complication of heavy infection with the much larger Ascaris lumbricoides.",
                "D": "Loeffler's syndrome is caused by the migration of parasite larvae (like Ascaris or Strongyloides) through the lungs; the Trichuris life cycle is confined to the GI tract."
