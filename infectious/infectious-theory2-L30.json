        "question": "A Kirby-Bauer test on a wound isolate shows a zone of inhibition for piperacillin (PIP) of 8 mm and for imipenem (IPM) of 27 mm. Given CLSI criteria (PIP S ≥21, R ≤17; IPM S ≥23, R ≤19), how should these be interpreted?",

For Imipenem (IPM), the 27 mm zone is ≥23 mm, interpreted as Susceptible (S). Therefore, the isolate is resistant to piperacillin and susceptible to imipenem.",

The 'D' shape indicates the presence of an erm gene, which confers inducible resistance to clindamycin in the presence of an inducer like erythromycin.
