        "question": "A 6-year-old child presents with a fever and painful swelling of the parotid glands, diagnosed as mumps (caused by Mumps virus). The concerned parent asks if the leftover amoxicillin from a previous ear infection could help. The doctor explains that it will not be effective. Which of the following is the most accurate reason for this?",
        "choices": {
            "A": "The Mumps virus is an RNA virus, and amoxicillin is only effective against DNA-based pathogens.",
            "B": "Antibiotics like amoxicillin target bacterial cell wall synthesis, a process and structure that viruses do not possess.",
            "C": "Mumps virus has a thick capsid that prevents the antibiotic from entering.",
            "D": "Viral infections must be treated with broad-spectrum antiviral agents, and amoxicillin is too specific.",
            "E": "The child's immune system has already produced antibodies, which would neutralize the antibiotic."
        },
        "correctAnswer": "B",
        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "This is the fundamental reason antibiotics are ineffective against viruses. Amoxicillin is a penicillin-class antibiotic that works by inhibiting the formation of peptidoglycan cell walls in bacteria. Since viruses are not cells and completely lack cell walls, the antibiotic has no target to act upon.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "Antibiotics do not differentiate between DNA and RNA; their targets are cellular structures or enzymes, not the type of nucleic acid.",
                "C": "While the viral capsid is a protective shell, the primary reason for ineffectiveness is the lack of a specific target, not a physical barrier to the drug.",
                "D": "This statement is flawed. Amoxicillin is an antibacterial, not a narrow-spectrum antiviral.",
                "E": "Antibodies produced by the immune system target pathogens (like the Mumps virus), not medications like antibiotics."

    {
        "question": "The term 'nucleocapsid' refers to the combination of the viral nucleic acid and its protective protein capsid. For an enveloped virus like Influenza, what is the relationship between the envelope and the nucleocapsid?",
        "choices": {
            "A": "The nucleocapsid is derived from the host cell membrane, while the envelope is synthesized by viral proteins.",
            "B": "The nucleocapsid is composed of lipids, and the envelope is composed of proteins called capsomeres.",
            "C": "The envelope is the outermost layer, a lipid membrane acquired from the host, which surrounds the internal nucleocapsid.",
            "D": "The envelope and the nucleocapsid are two terms for the same structure in enveloped viruses.",
            "E": "The envelope is located inside the nucleocapsid and contains the viral genome."
        },
        "correctAnswer": "C",
        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "This accurately describes the structure of an enveloped virus. The core of the virus is the nucleocapsid (nucleic acid + protein capsid). This entire structure is then wrapped in an envelope, which is a lipid bilayer membrane that the virus acquires from the host cell as it exits.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "The origins are reversed. The envelope is derived from the host membrane, while the nucleocapsid components are synthesized based on the viral genome.",
                "B": "The compositions are reversed. The nucleocapsid's capsid is made of protein units (capsomeres), and the envelope is primarily a lipid membrane.",
                "D": "They are distinct structures with different compositions and functions.",
                "E": "The spatial arrangement is wrong. The envelope is the outermost layer, surrounding the nucleocapsid."

        "question": "Which of these pairs correctly matches a virus type with its environmental stability?",
        "choices": {
            "A": "Enveloped Virus : Stable against detergents, heat, and acid.",
            "B": "Complex Virus : Stability depends only on whether its genome is DNA or RNA.",
            "C": "Enveloped Virus : Labile and spreads easily on fomites and through the fecal-oral route.",
            "D": "Naked Virus : Stable and can spread easily via fomites and the fecal-oral route.",
            "E": "Naked Virus : Labile and easily disrupted by drying and detergents."
        },
        "correctAnswer": "D",
        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "Naked (non-enveloped) viruses lack a fragile lipid envelope. Their tough protein capsid makes them environmentally stable and resistant to temperature, acid, detergents, and drying. This stability allows them to survive on surfaces (fomites) and pass through the gastrointestinal tract, facilitating fecal-oral transmission.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "Enveloped viruses are labile (fragile) and are easily disrupted by detergents, heat, and acid because these agents damage their essential lipid envelope.",
                "B": "Stability is primarily determined by the presence or absence of an envelope, not the type of nucleic acid.",
                "C": "While enveloped viruses are labile, this fragility means they do not spread easily on fomites or survive the fecal-oral route. They are typically spread through droplets and secretions.",
                "E": "Naked viruses are stable, not labile."

        "question": "A newly discovered virus is found to have a dsDNA genome. However, its replication cycle is unusual. After entering the cell nucleus, its DNA is transcribed into an RNA pre-genome. This RNA is then packaged into new capsids along with a specific viral polymerase. Inside the new capsid, this polymerase uses the RNA template to synthesize the final dsDNA genome. This 'RNA intermediate' strategy is characteristic of which Baltimore Class and virus family?",
