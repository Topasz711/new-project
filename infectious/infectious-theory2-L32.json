        "question": "A lab incubates a yeast isolate in horse serum at 37°C for two hours. Microscopic examination reveals long, non-septate filamentous extensions directly from the yeast cells without constriction at the point of origin. What is the most likely identification?",
        "choices": {
            "A": "Cryptococcus neoformans",
            "B": "Malassezia furfur",

            "correct": "The procedure described is the Germ Tube Test. The formation of a germ tube—a filamentous extension from the yeast cell that lacks constriction at its base—when incubated in serum at 37°C is a rapid, presumptive identification method for Candida albicans.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "Cryptococcus neoformans is identified by its prominent polysaccharide capsule (visualized with India ink) and does not form germ tubes.",
                "B": "Malassezia furfur is identified by its characteristic 'spaghetti and meatballs' appearance on skin scrapings and does not form germ tubes.",
                "D": "Trichosporon asahii is characterized by its pleomorphic morphology (true hyphae, pseudohyphae, blastoconidia, arthroconidia) but does not produce germ tubes.",
                "E": "Rhodotorula mucilaginosa is notable for producing distinctive pink-to-red colonies and does not form germ tubes."

            "correct": "The combination of clinical (hypo- or hyperpigmented macules) and microscopic ('spaghetti and meatballs' appearance) findings is classic for pityriasis (tinea) versicolor, caused by Malassezia furfur.",

                "A": "Tinea corporis ('ringworm') would show only septate hyphae on microscopy, not the mixed yeast-and-hyphae pattern.",
                "C": "Cutaneous candidiasis typically occurs in skin folds and presents as erythematous patches with satellite pustules.",
                "D": "Vitiligo is an autoimmune condition causing complete depigmentation; a KOH prep would be negative.",

            "correct": "Cryptococcus neoformans is famously associated with environments enriched by bird droppings, particularly from pigeons. The infection is acquired when dried yeast cells from this material become airborne and are inhaled into the lungs.",

                "A": "While animals can be infected, this is not the primary route of human transmission; the primary route is respiratory.",
