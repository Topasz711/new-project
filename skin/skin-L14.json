        "question": "A 55-year-old patient presents with multiple fragile, flaccid blisters on the trunk and severe, painful erosions in their mouth. Gentle shearing force on normal-appearing skin induces a new erosion. What is this clinical sign, and which condition is it most characteristic of?",

            "correct": "The clinical sign described is the **Nikolsky sign**, which is the ability to induce an erosion on normal-appearing skin with pressure or shear force. This sign indicates acantholysis (loss of cell-to-cell adhesion) in the epidermis. The clinical picture of **flaccid, fragile blisters and severe, painful oral mucous membrane erosions** is classic for **Pemphigus Vulgaris (PV)**.",

                "A": "Auspitz sign (pinpoint bleeding upon removal of a scale) is associated with psoriasis, which is not described here. The patient has flaccid blisters and erosions, not the typical scaly plaques of psoriasis.",
                "C": "The Asboe-Hansen sign (extension of a blister by pressing on it) is explicitly listed as negative in Bullous Pemphigoid. Bullous Pemphigoid also features **tense blisters**, not flaccid ones.",
                "D": "The \"carpet tack\" sign refers to the keratotic plugs seen on the undersurface of adherent scales removed from a Discoid LE (DLE) lesion. This is a feature of a chronic, scarring plaque, not an acute blistering condition.",
                "E": "The Koebner phenomenon is the development of new skin lesions (like psoriatic plaques) at sites of trauma. This is different from inducing an erosion by shearing already-present, normal-appearing skin."

It is described in the lecture as a brightly red, slightly edematous, sharply demarcated rash that is **precipitated by UV light** and **heals without scarring**. This is the hallmark of **Localized Acute Cutaneous LE (ACLE)**.",
