            "correct": "This is the correct term. The document defines **Lichenification** as a \"reactive thickening of the epidermis from repeated rubbing of the skin\". It explicitly states this process results in **\"Accentuated skin markings\"** and can **\"Resemble like 'tree bark'\"**.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "Atrophy is the opposite; it is a thinning of the skin, making it appear \"paper thin and wrinkled\".",
                "C": "Excoriation is a surface change resulting from scratching, but it refers to the break in the skin, not the thickening.",
                "D": "Erosion is a depressed lesion involving the \"loss of a portion or all of the viable epidermal... epithelium\". It is a loss of tissue, not a thickening.",
                "E": "Sclerosis is a \"hardening or induration of the skin that results from dermal fibrosis\". While the skin is hard, \"lichenification\" is the specific term for the epidermal thickening and accentuated markings caused by rubbing."
