        "question": "Which of the following statements correctly differentiates the basis of skin color between individuals with darkly pigmented skin and those with lightly pigmented skin?",
        "choices": {
            "A": "Individuals with dark skin have a significantly higher number of melanocytes per square millimeter in the stratum basale.",
            "B": "Individuals with dark skin have larger melanosomes, and the melanin degrades more slowly as it is transferred to keratinocytes.",
            "C": "Individuals with light skin primarily produce eumelanin, while individuals with dark skin primarily produce pheomelanin.",
            "D": "Individuals with light skin have their melanocytes located in the stratum spinosum, whereas in dark skin they are in the stratum basale.",
            "E": "The epidermal melanin unit in dark skin consists of one melanocyte per 10 keratinocytes, while in light skin it is one per 36 keratinocytes."
        },
        "correctAnswer": "B",
        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "This statement accurately captures the primary reasons for variation in skin pigmentation. The key differences are not in the number of melanin-producing cells but in their activity and the packaging of the pigment. 1.Larger Melanosomes: The provided lecture material explicitly states that individuals with dark skin have larger melanosomes compared to those with white skin, who have smaller melanosomes. 2.Slower Degradation: Although not explicitly stated in text, the diagram comparing darkly and lightly pigmented skin on page 13 visually demonstrates this concept. In darkly pigmented skin, melanosomes are shown to be larger and distributed throughout the epidermis. In lightly pigmented skin, the smaller melanosomes are clustered and break down more rapidly in the lower layers of the epidermis. This slower degradation in dark skin allows the melanin to persist and provide color to more layers of the skin.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "This is a common misconception. The lecture material clarifies that the number of melanocytes is the same in both dark and white skin. The difference lies in the amount and type of melanin produced, not the number of cells producing it.",
                "C": "This statement has the facts reversed. Eumelanin is the brown-to-black pigment that is more abundant in dark skin. Pheomelanin is the yellow-to-red pigment, which is found in higher proportions in individuals with lighter skin and red hair.",
                "D": "Melanocytes are consistently located in the stratum basale (the deepest layer of the epidermis) regardless of skin pigmentation. Their position does not change between different skin colors.",
                "E": "The lecture defines the epidermal melanin unit as one melanocyte serving approximately 36 surrounding keratinocytes. Crucially, the accompanying table indicates that this unit is the same for both dark and white skin."

            "E": "Cutaneous plexus"
        },
        "correctAnswer": "D",
        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "Why D is correct: The epidermis is avascular (lacks its own blood supply) and relies on diffusion from the underlying dermis for oxygen and nutrients. The subpapillary plexus (also called the superficial vascular plexus) is a network of blood vessels located at the junction of the papillary and reticular layers of the dermis. Crucially, this plexus gives rise to capillary loops that extend up into the dermal papillae , bringing the blood supply in close proximity to the epidermis to facilitate this nutrient transfer.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "Myenteric plexus & C. Submucous plexus: These are nerve plexuses that are part of the enteric nervous system, controlling motility and secretion in the gastrointestinal tract. They are not found in the skin.",
                "C": "Myenteric plexus & C. Submucous plexus: These are nerve plexuses that are part of the enteric nervous system, controlling motility and secretion in the gastrointestinal tract. They are not found in the skin.",
                "B": "Subcutaneous plexus & E. Cutaneous plexus: These are names for the deep vascular plexus, which is located deeper, near the boundary between the reticular dermis and the hypodermis. While it supplies the deeper structures of the dermis and skin appendages, it is the subpapillary plexus that directly serves the epidermis.",

Cutaneous plexus: These are names for the deep vascular plexus, which is located deeper, near the boundary between the reticular dermis and the hypodermis.

        "correctAnswer": "B",
        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "Why B is correct: The lecture explicitly states that keratohyalin granules, which are characteristic of the Stratum Granulosum, contain the protein profilaggrin. It further explains that profilaggrin is a precursor to filaggrin, a protein essential for the aggregation of keratin filaments to form mature keratin. Therefore, a defect in profilaggrin would directly impair the formation of these granules and the subsequent keratinization process in the Stratum Granulosum.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "Lamellar bodies in the Stratum Spinosum: Lamellar bodies (also called Odland bodies) contain lipids that contribute to the skin's water barrier; they are not associated with profilaggrin.",
                "C": "Neurosecretory granules in the Stratum Basale: These are found in Merkel cells and contain neurotransmitters for sensory function. They have no role in keratinization.",
                "D": "Melanosomes in the Stratum Basale: These granules, produced by melanocytes, contain melanin for UV protection  and are unrelated to profilaggrin.",
                "E": "Odland bodies in the Stratum Lucidum: Odland bodies are another name for lamellar bodies. Furthermore, the Stratum Lucidum is composed of dead cells that have already lost their organelles, so granule formation does not occur here."

        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "Why C is correct: Pacinian corpuscles are specialized sensory receptors that detect deep pressure and vibration. They are large, ovoid structures typically located deep within the skin, in the hypodermis or the deep dermis. The patient's symptoms of impaired deep pressure and vibration sensation align perfectly with the function and location of Pacinian corpuscles.",

These cells are described in the lecture as acting like **macrophages (making them phagocytic)** , arising from bone marrow, and having a **grooved or cleaved nucleus with clear cytoplasm**.

It is composed of **dense irregular connective tissue**, which is rich in **thick, coarse collagen fibers (type I)**. The dermis as a whole is responsible for providing the skin with its tensile strength and elasticity, with the reticular layer being the primary contributor due to its composition.
