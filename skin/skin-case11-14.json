        "question": "The patient undergoes an excisional biopsy. The pathology report returns as: 'Acral Lentiginous Melanoma, Breslow thickness 1.2 mm, no ulceration, margins clear'. Based on the NCCN guidelines referenced, what is the most appropriate next step in management?",
        "choices": {
            "A": "Observation only, as the margins of the biopsy were clear.",
            "B": "Start adjuvant immunotherapy with Pembrolizumab immediately without further surgery.",
            "C": "Wide Local Excision (WLE) with 0.5 cm margins only.",
            "D": "Immediate amputation of the foot to ensure clearance.",
            "E": "Wide Local Excision (WLE) with 1-2 cm margins and Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB)."

        "correctAnswer": "E",
        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "For melanomas with a **Breslow depth > 0.8 mm (or > 1.0 mm specifically)**, a **Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB)** is mandatory to check for spread. Additionally, the surgical margin for intermediate thickness (1-2 mm) is typically **1-2 cm Wide Local Excision (WLE)**.",
            "incorrect": {
                "A": "A simple biopsy often has narrow margins. Standard of care requires a Wide Local Excision to prevent recurrence.",
                "B": "Immunotherapy is usually reserved for later stages (Stage III or high-risk Stage II). Surgery and staging come first.",
                "C": "0.5 cm margins are **insufficient** for invasive melanoma.",
                "D": "Amputation is a last resort; limb-sparing surgery is preferred if margins can be achieved."
