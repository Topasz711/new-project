            "c": "Bullous Impetigo toxin must be secreted into the bloodstream to cause its local effect, while TSS toxin is active only when released directly into the deep tissues during bacteremia.",
            "d": "Bullous Impetigo toxin targets the dermal-epidermal basement membrane junction, while TSS toxin targets the stratum corneum keratinocytes in the upper epidermis.",

            "correct": "The toxin for Bullous Impetigo is an Exfoliatin (ETA/ETB), which is an **epidermolytic toxin** that specifically **cleaves Desmoglein 1 (Dsg1)**. The toxin for Toxic Shock Syndrome is TSST-1, which is a **superantigen** that non-specifically crosslinks the **MHC class II molecule and the T-cell receptor**, leading to polyclonal T-cell activation.",
            "incorrect": {
                "a": "The cleavage in both Bullous Impetigo and SSSS is superficial, occurring within or just below the stratum granulosum.",
                "c": "Exfoliatin can cause a systemic effect (SSSS) by dissemination, and the localized effect (Bullous Impetigo) does not require release into the bloodstream to act locally. TSST-1 causes TSS systemically, not just when released into deep tissues.",
                "d": "The cleavage in both Bullous Impetigo and SSSS is superficial, occurring within or just below the stratum granulosum. The dermal-epidermal junction is targeted in Bullous Pemphigoid.",

Examination reveals bright red, erythematous plaques in the skin folds, notably featuring small, detached papules and pustules at the periphery of the main plaques. Which diagnosis is most consistent with this clinical cluster?",
