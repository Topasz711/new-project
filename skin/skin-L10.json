It also reinforces this by calling macrophages **\"the central cellular players in the repair process\"**. Macrophages, particularly M2 macrophages, produce many key growth factors (like TGF-β and VEGF) that drive the proliferation of other cells.",

                "C": "Platelets are a major source of growth factors (like PDGF and TGF-β) immediately after injury (initial hemostasis), but their role is very early. Macrophages are the most important source for the sustained repair process.",
                "D": "Endothelial cells proliferate to form new blood vessels (angiogenesis) but are not the primary, \"most important\" source driving repair.",
                "E": "Keratinocytes are the epithelial cells of the skin. They proliferate to cover the wound but are not the main coordinating source of growth factors for the entire repair cascade."
