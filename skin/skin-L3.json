            "correct": "The presentation explicitly categorizes **Ectrodactyly-Ectodermal dysplasia-Clefting (EEC) syndrome** as a \"Disorder of ectodermal/mesodermal interaction\". This syndrome involves malformations of the extremities (ectrodactyly), abnormalities in ectodermal structures (like skin, hair, and teeth), and cleft lip/palate, reflecting a fundamental issue in how these two primary germ layers coordinate during development.",

                "D": "Lamellar ichthyosis is a disorder of excessive keratinization, resulting in dry, scaly skin. This is primarily a defect in the development of the ectoderm-derived epidermis, not an interaction disorder with the mesoderm."

The presentation notes this is an autosomal recessive condition where infants are born prematurely with \"very hard, thick skin covering most of their bodies\". This excessive keratinization leads to the characteristic armor-like plates and associated facial deformities.",
            "incorrect": {
