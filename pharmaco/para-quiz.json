            "correct": "These two drugs represent the two main classes of neuromuscular blockers. Succinylcholine is a depolarizing blocker; it acts as an acetylcholine (nACh) receptor agonist, binding to the receptor and causing a prolonged depolarization that leads to flaccid paralysis. Rocuronium is a non-depolarizing blocker; it acts as a competitive antagonist, preventing ACh from binding to its receptor, thereby preventing muscle depolarization.",

            "correct": "Pralidoxime (2-PAM) is a cholinesterase reactivator. Its mechanism is to attach to the organophosphate molecule that is bound to the acetylcholinesterase enzyme and break the bond between them. This action removes the poison from the enzyme, allowing the enzyme to be regenerated and resume its normal function of breaking down acetylcholine. This must be done before the bond 'ages' and becomes permanent.",

Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist and is very effective at blocking the muscarinic symptoms (bradycardia, salivation, bronchospasm). However, atropine has no effect at nicotinic receptors. Muscle weakness, fasciculations, and paralysis are nicotinic effects caused by ACh overstimulation at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ).
