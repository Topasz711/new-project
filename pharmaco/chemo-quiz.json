        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "Doxorubicin is listed as an anthracycline antibiotic. The documents explicitly state that \"Anthracyclines produce irreversible cardiotoxicity\", which can manifest as cardiomyopathy and heart failure.",

                "A": "Cisplatin is associated with severe emesis, nephrotoxicity, and ototoxicity, not cardiotoxicity.",

        "correctAnswer": "D",
        "reasoning": {
            "correct": "Docetaxel is classified as a taxane. The mechanism of action for taxanes is to bind to tubulin and stabilize microtubules, which inhibits mitosis. A major toxicity associated with this class is peripheral neuropathy, which presents with symptoms like numbness and tingling.",

                "A": "Cyclophosphamide's characteristic toxicity is hemorrhagic cystitis.",

            "correct": "The metabolic pathway shows that 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) is metabolized by the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Allopurinol inhibits this enzyme. This inhibition prevents the breakdown of 6-MP, leading to significantly increased drug levels and potential toxicity. Therefore, the dose of 6-MP must be reduced when given with allopurinol.",

            "correct": "The diagram clearly shows that Vinca alkaloids inhibit the polymerization of tubulin into microtubules, preventing mitotic spindle formation. In contrast, taxanes stabilize existing microtubules, preventing the cell from breaking them down, which also halts mitosis.",
