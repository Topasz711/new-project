      "A": "Free nerve ending",
      "B": "Ruffini ending",
      "C": "Pacinian corpuscle",
      "D": "Meissner's corpuscle",
      "E": "Merkel's disk"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "reasoning": {
      "correct": "The Pacinian corpuscle is specifically classified as a receptor that senses 'pressure' and 'vibration'. In terms of location, the slides illustrate it situated deep within the dermis and hypodermis.",
      "incorrect": {
        "A": "Free nerve endings primarily sense pain (nociceptors) and temperature (thermoreceptors), or crude touch, not vibration.",
        "B": "Ruffini endings are responsible for detecting 'stretching' of the skin.",
        "D": "Meissner's corpuscles are located closer to the epidermis (dermal papillae) and detect 'touch' (specifically shape and surfaces/tactile), not deep pressure.",
        "E": "Merkel's disks detect 'indentations' and are located at the epidermal-dermal border."

      "B": "Fasciculus gracilis",
      "C": "Anterior spinothalamic tract",
      "D": "Fasciculus cuneatus",
      "E": "Lateral spinothalamic tract"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "reasoning": {
      "correct": "The Fasciculus gracilis is part of the Dorsal Column pathway. It carries conscious proprioception, vibration, and fine touch from the lower body (below T6).",
      "incorrect": {
        "A": "The Dorsal spinocerebellar tract carries unconscious proprioception (not conscious) to the cerebellum.",
        "C": "The Anterior spinothalamic tract carries crude (gross) touch, not fine touch or proprioception.",
        "D": "The Fasciculus cuneatus carries the same modalities (conscious proprioception/fine touch) but specifically for the upper body (T6 and above).",

    "question": "A 55-year-old patient presents with a loss of pain and temperature sensation on the LEFT side of the body below the umbilicus. Based on the decussation pattern of the spinothalamic tract, where is the lesion likely located?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Bilateral spinal cord at T10",
      "B": "Right side of the medulla oblongata",

      "E": "Left side of the spinal cord at L1"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "reasoning": {
      "correct": "The Lateral Spinothalamic Tract carries pain and temperature. The fibers enter the spinal cord, ascend 1-2 segments in Lissauer's tract, and then cross the midline to the opposite (contralateral) side. Since the loss is on the LEFT, the lesion must be on the RIGHT. The umbilicus corresponds to T10. Because fibers ascend 1-2 segments before crossing, a lesion at T8 on the Right would block signals from Left T10 and below.",
      "incorrect": {
        "A": "A bilateral lesion would cause sensory loss on both sides of the body.",
        "B": "A lesion in the medulla would likely affect the entire side of the body (including the upper limb), not just below the umbilicus.",
        "D": "A lesion on the Left side would cause loss of pain/temperature on the Right side of the body (contralateral symptoms).",
        "E": "Similar to D, an ipsilateral (Left) lesion causes contralateral (Right) deficits. Additionally, L1 is too low to affect the umbilicus (T10)."

      "incorrect": {
        "A": "The Principal (Main) sensory nucleus is responsible for fine touch, proprioception, vibration, and pressure, but not the reflex arc itself.",
        "B": "The Solitary nucleus is related to visceral sensation and taste, not somatic proprioception.",
        "C": "The Spinal trigeminal nucleus is responsible for pain, temperature, and crude touch.",
        "D": "The Motor nucleus of V is the efferent (motor) limb of the reflex, but the sensory limb (the receptor nucleus asked for) is the Mesencephalic nucleus."

        "C": "The Lateral Corticospinal tract is a descending motor tract, not a sensory tract.",
        "D": "The Dorsal Spinocerebellar tract carries unconscious proprioception from the lower body and trunk (C8-L2).",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "reasoning": {
      "correct": "Astereognosis (inability to recognize objects by touch) is caused by damage to the Sensory Association Cortex (Areas 5 and 7). Since the sensory input crosses to the contralateral side, a deficit in the Right hand indicates a lesion in the Left cortex.",
      "incorrect": {
        "A": "Damage to the Primary Sensory Area (Area 3,1,2) causes Anesthesia (absence of all sensation), not just astereognosis.",

    "reasoning": {
      "correct": "The Ophthalmic nerve (V1) supplies the forehead and cornea. Pain sensation (and the sensory component of the corneal reflex) is processed by the Spinal Trigeminal Nucleus, which handles pain and temperature for the face.",
