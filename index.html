                choices: {
                    A: "The number of imported drugs used.",
                    B: "The number of adverse events reported per month.",

                reasoning: {
                    correct: "This is a classic 'Prescribing Pattern Indicator.' Monitoring the frequency of injections helps assess clinical decision-making, as overuse can be costly, increase the risk of infection, and may not be necessary. It is a direct measure of how drugs are being prescribed.",
                    incorrect: {
                        A: "A drug's country of origin does not determine if its use is rational.",
                        B: "This is an outcome indicator related to patient safety (pharmacovigilance), not a direct measure of the prescribing pattern itself.",
                        C: "Hospitals do not have budgets for advertising drugs to consumers.",
                        E: "The ratio of staff is a structural indicator of hospital resources, not a measure of prescribing behavior."

                    B: "To increase drug sales and exports worldwide.",
                    C: "To limit access to expensive, specialized drugs.",

                reasoning: {
                    correct: "This choice perfectly encapsulates the global definition of Rational Drug Use (RDU). The project's goal is to ensure that patients receive medicine appropriate for their clinical needs, in the correct dose, for an adequate duration, and at the lowest possible cost to them and the community, all guided by scientific evidence.",

                        A: "The goal is to reduce irrational drug use, not to stop the use of necessary medications.",

                    correct: "A primary indicator for the success of the RDU project is the reduction of antibiotic prescriptions for conditions that are often viral, such as upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) and acute diarrhea. This measure directly addresses the critical national goal of combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR).",
                    incorrect: {
                        B: "Hospitals in Thailand are guided by the National List of Essential Medicines, not by creating their own proprietary lists.",

                        D: "While their use should be rational, painkillers are essential medications and cannot be entirely removed from use.",
                        E: "Prescribing multiple antibiotics (polypharmacy) is generally discouraged as it increases the risk of adverse drug reactions and bacterial resistance."

                reasoning: {
                    correct: "The national RDU policy is driven at the highest level by the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH), which sets the overarching strategy. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the key operational agency within the MOPH responsible for drug regulation and implementation. Together, they form the primary authority for guiding and overseeing the project.",

                        A: "The Pharmacy Council is a professional body that governs pharmacists, not a government agency that implements national health policy.",

                        C: "While the FDA is a critical component, it operates under the broader policy direction of the MOPH, making the combined answer more complete.",

                    correct: "Community health volunteers (known in Thai as Or Sor Mor) are a cornerstone of Thailand's primary healthcare system. Empowering them to help patients follow medication instructions correctly and monitor for adverse effects is a key strategy for promoting rational drug use at the grassroots level.",
